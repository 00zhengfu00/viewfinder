We call the services provided by Viewfinder whether accessed from the site or the app, our "service(s)". This document outlines the terms of use ("Terms") applicable to your use of our services, so please review it carefully. Here at Viewfinder, we recognize the importance of privacy and personal information. We strive to be open and honest with users about these matters.

If you have questions about these Terms or our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, please don’t hesitate to e-mail us at <a href="mailto:support@emailscrubbed.com" target="_blank">support@viewfinder.co</a>.</p>

	
<h3 class="h3 semidark">Acceptance of Terms</h3>


<p>These Terms govern your access to and use of the site and the app, including any content, functionality and services offered through Viewfinder. Before using Viewfinder, you are required to read, understand, and agree to these Terms. You can only set up an account with Viewfinder once you have agreed to and accepted these Terms.</p>

<p><b>By creating an account with Viewfinder, you accept and agree to be subject to and abide by these Terms and our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, which is incorporated here by reference.</b> If you do not want to agree to these Terms or the <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, unfortunately you will not be permitted to access or use Viewfinder.</p>

<p>Viewfinder reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms and the <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> at any time. If the alterations constitute a material change to these Terms or the <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, Viewfinder will notify you by posting an announcement on the services. What constitutes a material change will be determined by Viewfinder. However, it is your responsibility to read and become familiar with any modifications that we may make. Using our services following notification of a material change to the Terms and/or <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> shall constitute your acceptance of the Terms and/or <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> as modified.</p>






<h3 class="h3 semidark">Registration and Use of Viewfinder</h3>

<p>To use Viewfinder's services, you need to register to create an account with Viewfinder. You register your Viewfinder account through an email or mobile phone verification process. In that verification process, Viewfinder accesses certain information, such as your full name, your email address, your mobile operating system, and your device name. The registration information you provide must be accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of these Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your Viewfinder account.</p>

<p>Viewfinder users must provide their real names and information when they register. You may not use the name of another person or entity that is not lawfully available for use, a name or trademark that is subject to any rights of another person or entity without appropriate authorization, or a name that is offensive, vulgar, or obscene.</p>

<p>To find contacts on Viewfinder, upon your request and with your permission, we will access the personal information that you have provided to Gmail, Facebook or your iOS Address Book (such as your real name, email address, and other information you make available to Gmail and/or Facebook (e.g., picture, gender, or time zone)) and use that information to import contacts. The specific information that we extract may depend on the privacy terms of Gmail and/or Facebook and your privacy settings on those services. <b>Viewfinder does not post your Content to any social network.</b></p>

<p>You are solely responsible for all activities conducted through your Viewfinder account. It is your responsibility to immediately notify Viewfinder by emailing <a href="mailto:support@emailscrubbed.com" target="_blank">support@viewfinder.co</a> of any unauthorized use of your account.</p>

<p>You may only use the services if you can form a binding contract with Viewfinder, and only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable state, local, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations. Services are available only to individuals who are (i) either at least 18 years old, or (ii) at least 13 years old and are authorized to access the site or the app by a parent or legal guardian. If you have authorized a minor to use the services, you are responsible for the online conduct of such minor as well as the consequences of any misuse of the services by the minor. Parents and legal guardians are warned that the services may display photographs and images containing nudity and violence (or that may otherwise be inappropriate for viewing by minors) and that may be offensive to some. <b>You may not use Viewfinder if you are under 13.</b> The services are not available to any users previously removed from the services by Viewfinder.</p>

<p>Creating an account with Viewfinder gives you access to the services in our sole discretion. You are solely responsible for your conduct on the Viewfinder services. You are solely responsible for any data, text, information, screen names, graphics, photos, profiles, audio and video clips, links, etc. ("User Content") that you make available on the services. To that end, you must not abuse, harass, threaten, impersonate, or intimidate other Viewfinder users. In short,</p>

<p>You must not modify, adapt, or hack Viewfinder or modify another website or mobile application so as to falsely imply that it is Viewfinder. You must not access Viewfinder’s private API by any other means than the Viewfinder site or app themselves. You must not crawl, scrape, or otherwise cache any content from Viewfinder, including, but not limited to, user profiles and photos. You must not transmit any viruses, worms, or any code that is or may be destructive in nature.</p>

<p>You agree that you will not use Viewfinder to send unwanted email, comments, chain letters, junk mail, solicitations (commercial or non-commercial) or make any use of distribution lists that include any recipient that has not given specific permission to be included in such a list or process (that is, no spam).</p>

<p>You may terminate your Viewfinder account at any time by sending an email request to <a href="mailto:support@emailscrubbed.com" target="_blank">support@viewfinder.co</a>.</p>

<p>If you terminate your Viewfinder account, you will not be able to regain access to your account again. Viewfinder will not retain most of your personal information, although some personally identifiable information, such as your name, and copies of some materials, such as photos and comments, may remain in our servers for technical reasons. Certain User Content will remain available to other Viewfinder users. For more details, please review the "Your Content" section below.</p>

<p>We may permanently or temporarily terminate, deactivate, or suspend your user account or access to the services for any reason, without notice or liability to you, including if, in our sole determination, you violate any provision of these Terms, or for no reason.</p>

<p>We will continue to make Viewfinder a better service for our users. Accordingly, we may, without notice, change the services, create usage limits, add features, delete features, or even stop providing the services to you or users generally.</p>

<p>All provisions of the Terms that by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, those governing ownership, warranty disclaimers, indemnities and limitations of liability.</p>






<h3 class="h3 semidark">Your Content</h3>

<p>Viewfinder allows you to upload content on the services, including photos, comments, and other materials. Please read this section carefully before posting, uploading, or otherwise making available any content to the services.</p>

<p><b>You retain all of your Intellectual Property Rights in all of the User Content you post to our services.</b> Anything that you upload, post, or otherwise make available on our services, including all Intellectual Property Rights in such content, is referred to as "User Content". "Intellectual Property Rights" means all patent rights; copyright rights; moral rights; rights of publicity; trademark, trade dress and service mark rights (and all associated goodwill); trade secret rights; and all other intellectual property and proprietary rights as may now exist or hereafter come into existence, and all applications for any of these rights and registrations, renewals and extensions of any of these rights, in each case under the laws of any state, country, territory or other jurisdiction. </p>

<p><b>Viewfinder does not sell your Content to third parties.</b> By making User Content available to the Viewfinder services, you are granting Viewfinder a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable, worldwide license to use, host, display, store, cache, reproduce, publish, transmit, modify, re-format, re-arrange, distribute, and adapt (including, without limitation, in order to conform it to the requirements of any networks, devices, services, or media through which the Services are available), and create derivative works of your User Content on Viewfinder. The rights you grant Viewfinder are for the limited purpose of operating and providing the services, improving the services, and allowing Viewfinder to develop new services. The reference in this license to "derivative works" is not intended to give Viewfinder itself a right to make substantive changes or derivations to your User Content, but does enable other Viewfinder users to redistribute User Content by means of their own Viewfinder Account in a manner that allows users to, for example, add captions, text, commentary, filters, photo-editing, or other Content in connection with your User Content. Nothing in these Terms shall restrict Viewfinder’s rights under separate licenses to User Content.</p>

<h4 class="h4 semidark">Private Content</h4>

<p>The following terms and conditions apply to Content that you allow Viewfinder to access and index, but that you do not share with other Viewfinder users:</p>

<p><b>Viewfinder does not upload your Content without your permission.</b> When you activate your Viewfinder account, Viewfinder will access and index Content from your mobile device’s camera roll to a local storage file on your mobile device. </p>

<p>By activating Cloud Storage, you permit Viewfinder to upload your Content to a cloud-based server, in which Viewfinder will synchronize and back up your Content among multiple devices.</p>

<p>You can remove your Content from Viewfinder at any time by deleting it. If you terminate your Viewfinder account, or if you delete any User Content from your account, Viewfinder may retain your User Content for a commercially reasonable period of time for back-up, archival, or audit purposes.</p>

<h4 class="h4 semidark">Shared Content</h4>

<p>The following terms and conditions apply to Content that you allow Viewfinder to access and index, and that you have shared with other Viewfinder users:</p>

<p>Please remember that Viewfinder is a public service, and that other users may display, see, use, share, modify, and re-arrange any User Content that you choose to share with others through the services. Once you have shared Content, Viewfinder can make no representations, assurances, or warranties that such Content will not be broadly and publicly disseminated. <b>In short: be thoughtful about how you decide to share your Content!</b></p>

<p>You may share your User Content with other Viewfinder users or non-users via Viewfinder’s services. You also have the ability to share Content that has been shared to you from other Viewfinder users in your network.</p>

<p>You can also unshare User Content that you have previously shared. To unshare, within Seven (7) Days of making Content publicly available, you may select the unshare button and it will be removed from the Viewfinder library of other Viewfinder users, provided that the Content has not been shared to more than 100 unique conversations.</p>

<p>Viewfinder and other Viewfinder users may retain and continue to use, host, display, store, cache, reproduce, publish, transmit, modify, re-format, re-arrange, distribute, and create derivative works of any of your User Content that you have posted to public or semi-public areas of the services.</p>

<p>User Content that you have shared with another Viewfinder user for at least Seven (7) Days may no longer be unshared.</p>

<p>Importantly, we must reiterate that Viewfinder cannot prevent Viewfinder users from taking screen shots or captures or from downloading User Content and subsequently making your Content publicly available. If the potential for the public dissemination of your User Content concerns you, please do not share that Content.</p>

<h4 class="h4 semidark">All User Content</h4>

<p>By making content available on the services, you represent and warrant that (1) you are the owner of all rights, including any copyrights in and to all User Content you make available to the services; (2) you have the full and complete right to enter into this agreement and to grant to Viewfinder the rights in the User Content herein granted, and that no further permissions are required from, nor payments required to be made to any other person in connection with the use by Viewfinder of the User Content as contemplated herein; and (3) the User Content does not defame any person and does not infringe upon the copyright, moral rights, publicity rights, privacy rights or any other right of any person, or violate any law or judicial or governmental order. We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to remove User Content from the services for any reason, including User Content that we think violates these Terms.</p>

<p>We at Viewfinder are particularly sensitive to the rights of third-party creators and content owners. We expect such sensitivity from our users, too. Accordingly, you agree that any User Content that you make available to the services does not and will not violate any law or infringe the rights of any third-party, including without limitation any Intellectual Property Rights, publicity rights, or privacy rights. We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to remove User Content from the services for any reason, including User Content that we believe violates these Terms. Ultimately, you are best situated to know whether the content you make available to Viewfinder is allowed to be there. So please be careful when deciding whether to make User Content available on our services, including whether you can share, modify, or re-arrange User Content with Viewfinder.</p>

<p>Please remember that you are solely responsible for your interactions with other users – it is totally up to you whether you share your Content with others. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other users. Viewfinder will have no liability for your interactions with other users, or for any user’s action or inaction. By using Viewfinder responsibly, you will help Viewfinder be a better experience for everyone in the Viewfinder community.</p>

<p>We want Viewfinder to be the best service it can be. One of the best ways to improve Viewfinder is by receiving feedback from you, the user. At various times, you may choose to provide or we may invite or solicit feedback, comments, or ideas on how to improve the services or our products ("Feedback"). By providing Feedback, you agree that your disclosure is gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction; your disclosure will not place Viewfinder under any fiduciary or other obligation; and we are free to use, disclose and otherwise exploit the Feedback without any restriction and without compensation to you. By acceptance of your submission, Viewfinder does not waive any rights to use similar or related Feedback previously known to Viewfinder, developed by its employees, or obtained from sources other than you.</p>







<h3 class="h3 semidark">Viewfinder Content</h3>

<p>With the exception of User Content, the services themselves, all content and other subject matter included on or within the services, and all Intellectual Property Rights in or related to the services or any such content or other subject matter ("Viewfinder Content") are the property of Viewfinder and its licensors. Except as expressly provided in these Terms, you agree not to use, modify, reproduce, distribute, sell, license, or otherwise exploit the Viewfinder Content without our permission.</p>

<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, we grant you a license to use the services, including accessing and viewing Viewfinder Content, for your personal, noncommercial use to allow you to express yourself, discuss public issues, report on issues of public concern, engage in parody and otherwise use the services as expressly permitted by the features of the services and these Terms.

<h3 class="h3 semidark">Copyright Policy</h3>

<p>Viewfinder has adopted and implemented the Viewfinder Copyright Policy in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the Communications Decency Act. For more information, please read our <a href="/copyright">Copyright Policy</a>.</p>

<h4 class="h4 semidark">Copyright Complaints</h4>

<p>Viewfinder respects the intellectual property rights of others. It is our policy to respond promptly to any claim that User Content posted on the site or the app infringes the copyright or other intellectual property ("infringement") of any person. Viewfinder will use reasonable efforts to investigate notices of alleged infringement and will take appropriate action under applicable intellectual property law and these Terms where it believes an infringement has taken place; including removing or disabling access to the User Content claimed to be infringing and/or terminating accounts and access to the services.</p>

<p>To notify Viewfinder of a possible infringement, please submit your notice in writing to <a href="mailto:copyright@emailscrubbed.com" target="_blank">copyright@viewfinder.co</a>. Your notice must provide a detailed description of the alleged infringement sufficient to enable Viewfinder to locate the potentially infringing Content, and to make a reasonable determination. Please be aware that you may be held accountable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) for misrepresenting that any User Content is infringing your copyrights.</p>

<p>In the event that Viewfinder removes or disables User Content in response to a notice of infringement, we will make a reasonable attempt to contact the user who posted the relevant Content. If you feel that your User Content is not infringing, you may provide Viewfinder with a counter-notice in writing to <a href="mailto:copyright@emailscrubbed.com" target="_blank">copyright@viewfinder.co</a>. Your counter-notice must provide sufficient information to enable Viewfinder to make a reasonable determination. Please be aware that you may be held accountable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) if you materially misrepresent that your Content is not infringing the copyrights of others.</p>

<p>If you are uncertain whether certain User Content may infringe on the intellectual property of another, we recommend that you seek the advice of an attorney before making any use of that content.</p>

<h3 class="h3 semidark">Disclaimers</h3>

<p>THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ALL CONTENT AND OTHER SUBJECT MATTER INCLUDED WITHIN THE SERVICES, ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, VIEWFINDER SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. VIEWFINDER TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY AND ASSUMES NO LIABILITY FOR ANY USER CONTENT THAT YOU OR ANY OTHER USER OR THIRD PARTY POSTS OR SENDS OVER THE SERVICE. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR USER CONTENT AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF POSTING OR PUBLISHING IT, AND YOU AGREE THAT WE ARE ONLY ACTING AS A PASSIVE CONDUIT FOR YOUR AND OTHER USERS’ ONLINE DISTRIBUTION AND PUBLICATION OF YOUR AND THEIR USER CONTENT.

<h3 class="h3 semidark">Limitation of Liability</h3>

<p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICES, VIEWFINDER CONTENT, AND USER CONTENT REMAINS WITH YOU AND YOU USE THE SERVICES AT YOUR OWN RISK. YOU AGREE THAT NEITHER VIEWFINDER NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SERVICES WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR FROM THE SERVICES, OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, USER CONTENT, VIEWFINDER CONTENT, OR FROM ANY COMMUNICATIONS, INTERACTIONS OR MEETINGS WITH OTHER USERS OF THE SERVICES OR OTHER PERSONS WITH WHOM YOU COMMUNICATE OR INTERACT AS A RESULT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT VIEWFINDER HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.</p>

<p>IN NO EVENT WILL VIEWFINDER’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY, OR THAT OF ITS MEMBERS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE SERVICES, OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, USER CONTENT OR VIEWFINDER CONTENT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100). THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN VIEWFINDER AND YOU. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

<h3 class="h3 semidark">Arbitration and Governing Law</h3>

<h4 class="h4 semidark">Arbitration</h4>

<p>For any dispute you may have with Viewfinder, you must first contact us at <a href="mailto:support@emailscrubbed.com" target="_blank">support@viewfinder.co</a> and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that we are unable to resolve a dispute after attempting to resolve it informally, you and Viewfinder agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, "Claims"), through binding arbitration conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein.</p>

<p>Unless you and Viewfinder agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the City, County and State of New York, New York. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, except that Viewfinder will pay for your reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000 and is non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If you wish to opt out of this arbitration clause, you must contact us at <a href="mailto:support@emailscrubbed.com" target="_blank">support@viewfinder.co</a> within seven (7) days of accessing the services. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorized access to the services.</p>

<p>ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A NAMED OR UNNAMED MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, UNLESS BOTH YOU AND VIEWFINDER SPECIFICALLY AGREE TO DO SO IN WRITING FOLLOWING INITIATION OF THE ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND VIEWFINDER ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>

<h4 class="h4 semidark">Governing Law</h4>

<p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, U.S.A., without regard to conflict of laws provisions. If any provision of these terms shall be held to be invalid, illegal, unenforceable, or in conflict with the law of any jurisdiction, the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and shall remain in full force and effect.
</p>

<h4 class="h4 semidark">No Waiver</h4>

<p>No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other terms, and Viewfinder’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
