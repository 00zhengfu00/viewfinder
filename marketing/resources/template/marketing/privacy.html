				<p>Viewfinder allows users to access, organize, and share their lives in unprecedented ways. Viewfinder's success depends upon our users' comfort with the way their personal information is used and shared.</p>
				<p>We recognize that your photos are special. They contain some of the most treasured memories in your life and in the lives of your friends and family. The power of Viewfinder's services derives from your trust that we will treat your photos with the care and respect that they deserve. <b>Above all, we want to ensure to you that everything we do at Viewfinder is done with your privacy in mind.</b></p>
				<p>This is our privacy policy. In it, we explain exactly what information we collect, what we do with your information, and – just as importantly – what we do not do with your information. Our goal is to be transparent. By accessing <a href="http://viewfinder.co" target="_blank">viewfinder.co</a> or by using the Viewfinder mobile application (the "services"), you are expressly accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. As always, if you have questions or comments, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@emailscrubbed.com" target="_blank">support@viewfinder.co</a>.</p>
				

<h3 class="h3 semidark">Information Collected by Viewfinder</h3>

<p>Generally, we collect two types of information: personal information and non-identifiable information.</p>

<h4 class="h4 semidark">How We Collect Information</h4>


<ul>
	<li>We collect account information that you voluntarily provide that is necessary for us to authenticate your identity when creating an account, such as your name, your email address, and certain information about your mobile device (e.g., name of device, operating system, mobile platform, and/or mobile number).</li>
	<li>We collect and store user-provided content, including but not limited to photos and comments that are shared with our services. As you personalize your account, we will collect any information that you voluntarily provide to us.</li>
	<li>We automatically collect information when you use our services by means of certain technological tools (e.g., cookies).</li>
	<li>We have processes in place to control and limit the means by which other users of the system and Viewfinder employees may gain access to personally identifiable information.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="h4 semidark">Profile Information</h4>


<ul>
	<li>When you create an account on Viewfinder's services you will provide information to create an account and verify your account on your mobile device.</li>
	<li>If you choose to import contacts from certain third-party services, such as iOS Address Book, Google and/or Facebook, you will provide information related to those services (e.g., the profile data you allow to be shared via your Google or Facebook account). (<i>And just to be clear: Viewfinder does not post your photos or messages to any social networks.</i>)</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="h4 semidark">User Content</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Viewfinder provides a service that allows users to share content such as photos and comments. We store content and its associated metadata, either provided explicitly (e.g., a title or caption) or implicitly (e.g., latitude/longitude or date-of-creation timestamp). Depending on a user's app settings and behavior, this information may be provided automatically (e.g., if “Cloud Storage” is enabled on the mobile app and a new photo is taken) or explicitly (e.g., a photo is shared or a comment is made on a photo).</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="h4 semidark">Automatic Information</h4>

<ul>
	<li>We receive and store certain types of information when you interact with the services. Viewfinder and its authorized agents automatically receive and record certain information (often referred to as “traffic data”) on their server logs from your browser or mobile device, including your IP address, cookies, and the various requests you make. Viewfinder uses this data to help diagnose and fix problems on the services, to analyze user trends, and to generally administer the services.</li>
	<li>We have processes in place to elide or otherwise anonymize personally identifiable information, sensitive metadata (e.g., location), or explicit content (e.g., comment text, .jpg thumbnails) from log files and cookies.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="h3 semidark">Email Communications</h3>

<p>Viewfinder will never provide your email address to a third-party without your permission (additional detail below under "Sharing Your Information"). Of course, if another user has your email address (via their contacts), that address may be used to authenticate your identity and communicate with you on Viewfinder. In addition, if you are added to a Conversation, your email address will be available to the users in the Conversation as part of your user profile.</p>
<p>We may send emails with Viewfinder-related updates, news, offers, or promotions. You may also receive notifications from Viewfinder informing you of activity on the services (i.e., photos that have been shared with you or messages that have been sent to you). If you do not want to receive future emails from us, please follow the instructions contained in a given email message. Please note that you will continue to receive all sensitive and security or administrative system emails (such as those regarding user authentication issues) and legal notices (for example, updates to our policies) from us.
</p>


<h3 class="h3 semidark">Cookies</h3>

<p>Cookies are small data files that we transfer to your local mobile device or computer's hard drive to enable our systems to authenticate your device or browser. They tell us how and when pages in our services are visited and by how many people. Viewfinder cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your email address is. If you do not wish our servers to receive cookies from your mobile device, you must log out of Viewfinder. The "help" portion on many web browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We recommend that you leave the cookies activated because they allow you to utilize many of Viewfinder's features and functionality. Some of our partners may use cookies on the Viewfinder services. We have no access to or control over these cookies.</p>


<h3 class="h3 semidark">Sharing Your Information</h3>

<p>The ability to connect people to share and discover photos, events, and conversations is vital to the Viewfinder experience. This makes user information an integral part of our platform. <b>Viewfinder will not sell or rent your personal information to anyone.</b></p>
<p>Viewfinder will share your personal information only in the following ways:</p>

<ul>	
	<li>Viewfinder Personnel: Viewfinder personnel and authorized consultants, business partners, and/or contractors may have access to user information if necessary in the normal course of Viewfinder business.</li>
	<li>Business Transfers: Viewfinder may choose to buy or sell certain assets from time to time. In these types of transactions, user information may be one of the business assets that may be transferred. For example, if Viewfinder, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets that would be transferred. In the event of such a business transfer, the acquirer may continue to use your user information pursuant to the conditions set forth in this policy.</li>	<li>Protection of Viewfinder and Others: Viewfinder may disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to comply with a law; to enforce or apply our Terms of Service and other policies; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Viewfinder, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. In appropriate circumstance, we will make a good faith effort to notify you when we disclose your information to law enforcement.</li>
	<li>User Profile information: Information collected during registration and subsequent visits, such as your full name, email address, and location, may be displayed to other Viewfinder users in your user profile or in shared photos and content.</li>
	<li>With Your Consent: Except as noted above, we will contact you before your personal information is shared with third parties or used for a purpose incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected, and you will be able to opt out to prevent the sharing of this information.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="h3 semidark">Keeping Your Information Secure</h3>

<p>Viewfinder requires you to authenticate your identity during account creation by providing your name and email address and/or mobile number. Viewfinder sends you an email or mobile verification to ensure that the user creating account is authorized to do so. </p>
<p>Users may connect with contacts by means of third parties, such as iOS Address Book, Gmail and/or Facebook. Your Viewfinder account information is protected by your password to those third party sites for your privacy and security.
Only one user account is permitted per mobile device. Protect against unauthorized Viewfinder communications from your mobile device by protecting access to your mobile device. Your Viewfinder content is locally cached and available on your device without a password (just as you can access your iPhone camera roll without an additional password). Prevent unauthorized access to Viewfinder on your mobile device by password-protecting your mobile device. On a web browser, protect against unauthorized access to your Viewfinder account by logging off both Viewfinder and any third-party platform (Gmail and/or Facebook) once you have finished using a shared computer.</p>
<p>Only employees who need personal information to perform a specific job are granted access to your user information. (For example, a customer service representative responding to a user request may access that user's account.) All of our employees are kept up to date on our privacy and security practices.</p>
<p>Viewfinder takes great pains to protect you from phishing, spam, and other unsolicited communications that could potentially lead to identity theft (not to mention aggravation). We will never request your credit card information or identification information in a non-secure or unsolicited communication.</p>
<p>Viewfinder will make all legally required disclosures of any breach of security, confidentiality, or integrity of stored personal data (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you by email or conspicuous posting on the services. Disclosure will take place in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, allowing for (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.
</p>


<h3 class="h3 semidark">Children Under 18</h3>

<p>You must be 13 years and older to register to use the Viewfinder services. Viewfinder does not intentionally collect information about children. Protecting the privacy of children is of the highest priority to us. If we obtain actual knowledge that Viewfinder has collected information from a child under the age of 13, we will take steps to delete that information as quickly as possible.</p>

<h3 class="h3 semidark">Changes to the Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>We may change this Privacy Policy at various times, following our process for modifying our Terms of Use. Viewfinder's use of information is subject to the Privacy Policy in place at the time that such information is used.</p>


<h3 class="h3 semidark">Conditions of Use</h3>

<p>If you decide to use the Viewfinder services, any possible dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of New York law.</p>


<h3 class="h3 semidark">Effective Date of Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of August 1, 2013.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns about your privacy using the services or this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@emailscrubbed.com" target="_blank">support@viewfinder.co</a>.</p>
